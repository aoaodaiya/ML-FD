# ML-FD: Meta-learning domain generalization method based on Fourier transform data augmentation
## Abstract

With the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, the generalization capability of models has become a key issue of concern for researchers and engineers. In real-world applications, models need to maintain good performance when faced with diverse and previously unseen data distributions. However, existing domain generalization methods have certain limitations in addressing this challenge. This paper aims to implement a meta-learning domain generalization method based on Fourier transform data augmentation (ML-FD). By leveraging data augmentation and a meta-learning framework, the proposed method enables models to generalize to multiple unseen domains with only one training domain. Compared to other domain generalization methods with similar accuracy on the Digits-DG datasets, the method implemented in this paper exhibits significant advantages in terms of model training time.
